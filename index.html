    <h1>A Journey to The Jungle</h1>
    <h2>Amin Abid</h2>
    <p>The story behind my project is going to be representing my passion for life and music. 
When I was a child, I have always imagined myself in the jungle like Tarzan. The character in this track is me discovering the jungle and its wonders converted in melancholic shades of House Music and soft beats with jungle theme in the background.
